            "A degree in philosophy provides graduates with skills that are highly sought after in today’s market. According to the Committee on Economic Development, which surveyed CEOs and business leaders, the two skills that were deemed both essential and in short supply are critical thinking and problem-solving. Writing skills were the third most essential skill among those desirable skills that are difficult to find in new graduates entering the job market. These three skills are among the most central to philosophical education.",
            "Philosophy courses strive to teach students not only about the basics of effective communication in writing and speech, but ultimately about the way to argue a position based upon a critical analysis of textual evidence. Philosophy students learn how to craft persuasive arguments that attunes them to the interpretive power of writing. Philosophy provides some of the best preparation for graduate and professional schools, as measured by test scores like GRE and LSAT, of almost any other majors."
