UT Dallas offers two different tuition plans. The variable tuition rate plan is based on a traditional plan that only locks tuition rates in for one academic year at a time. The rates on the variable tuition plan are subject to change each academic year and is a lower rate over the guaranteed tuition rate.
The guaranteed tuition plan is a plan that locks tuition rates in for four consecutive years and protects the student against increases during those four years. This plan is designed to aid students and families in the budget and planning of college expenses and is initially higher than the variable tuition rate.
All new admitted students are automatically placed into the Variable Tuition Rate plan and no action is required.
The deadline for spring 2025 admits to change their tuition plan to the guaranteed rate has passed.
Students admitted for the summer 2025 semester will have the opportunity to change their tuition plan beginning April 1, 2025.
The following grid is an example of tuition expenses, comparing the variable tuition rate plan and the guaranteed tuition plan for a new incoming undergraduate resident student. The example enrollment of 15 hours per semester.
Note: Example for undergraduate resident students only and does not include course-related fees, or other charges.

A note regarding tuition rates for the Class of 2016 (new incoming students for Fall 2012)

This new rate will be their guaranteed rate through 2016. Students who enroll at UT Dallas from Sept. 1, 2012 through Aug. 31, 2013 will be subject to this new rate.
Questions you may have:
Was I overcharged for the Fall 2012 semester?

No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the tuition subsidy became available in November 2012.
