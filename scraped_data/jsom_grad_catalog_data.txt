The Master of Business Administration (MBA) is a minimum 53 semester credit hours degree program at Naveen Jindal School of Management (JSOM) that prepares students to think, plan and develop business solutions by utilizing strong analytical problem-solving skills, team oriented approaches, and strategic planning. The School offers four MBA programs: MBA Full-Time Cohort, Professional MBA Evening Cohort, Professional MBA Flex, and Professional MBA Online. The MBA Full-Time Cohort begins a new class each fall and requires a two-week boot camp directly preceding the start of the semester.  The Professional MBA Evening Cohort also requires a one-day orientation.  At the option of the student, a concentration may be developed by taking a set of electives related to an area of interest.
NOTE:The Executive Education area of the Naveen Jindal School of Management offers several distinctive and separate MBA programs, which retain the same set of MBA core courses but have their own set of specific topical electives. These include the Executive MBA (EMBA), the Global Leadership MBA (GLEMBA), the Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Project Management, the Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Product Lifecycle and Supply Chain Management, and the Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Healthcare Leadership and Management.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). In order to graduate, students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in the core GPA, degree GPA (exclusive of prerequisite courses), and cumulative GPA (all courses taken at the graduate level). Students can obtain a double MBA and MS degree by taking a minimum of 63 semester credit hours (assuming they meet all the degree requirements for both programs).
