UT Dallas offers two different tuition plans. The variable tuition rate plan is based on a traditional plan that only locks tuition rates in for one academic year at a time. The rates on the variable tuition plan are subject to change each academic year and is a lower rate over the guaranteed tuition rate.
The guaranteed tuition plan is a plan that locks tuition rates in for four consecutive years and protects the student against increases during those four years. This plan is designed to aid students and families in the budget and planning of college expenses and is initially higher than the variable tuition rate.
All new admitted students are automatically placed into the Variable Tuition Rate plan and no action is required.
Students admitted for the summer 2025 semester may change their tuition plan beginning April 2, 2025. The deadline to change your tuition plan is May 22, 2025.
The following grid is an example of tuition expenses, comparing the variable tuition rate plan and the guaranteed tuition plan for a new incoming undergraduate resident student. The example enrollment of 15 hours per semester.

A note regarding tuition rates for the Class of 2016 (new incoming students for Fall 2012)
By direction of The University of Texas System Board of Regents, the tuition rate set for the Class of 2016 was reduced by subsidy.

This new rate will be their guaranteed rate through 2016. Students who enroll at UT Dallas from Sept. 1, 2012 through Aug. 31, 2013 will be subject to this new rate.
Questions you may have:
Was I overcharged for the Fall 2012 semester?
No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the subsidy was provided in November of the Fall semester and has been apportioned to reduce the rate for all four years of the Class of 2016’s tuition guarantee.
Will I get a rebate for Fall 2012?
No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the tuition subsidy became available in November 2012.
