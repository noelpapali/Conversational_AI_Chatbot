  name: Duggirala Endowed Executive MBA Fellowship
  description: Paragraph: This fellowship was established in honor of Venkateswara Duggirala, an Indian-born Global Leadership Executive MBA graduate. “DV” grew up in a lower middle class where it was next to impossible to think of continuous and experiential education. He worked in India, transitioning early to Enterprise Resource Planning. This allowed him the opportunity to operate as a global citizen. He moved to the U.S. and realized that the missing link in his education was an executive MBA from UT Dallas – providing the perfect blend of experience, flexibility, content and brand.
