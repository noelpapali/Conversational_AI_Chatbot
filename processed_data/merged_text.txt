  Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.
  What does it mean to have a PhD?
  Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.
  Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
  Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
  The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.

Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.





 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.







 

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.







 

What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.







 

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.

Steve Sauerwald


Associate Professor, Department of Managerial Studies, College of Business, University of Illinois at Chicago




In addition to providing outstanding doctoral training, the faculty helped me to identify high impact research areas and provided incredible mentorship to bring those projects to fruition. I also benefited from a great cohort of supportive and bright PhD students who made the journey even more rewarding

 









 


Bharadwaj Kadiyala


Assistant Professor,

  Eccles School of Business, University of Utah



The PhD program at UTD provides a fantastic environment for learning and sharing ideas with faculty who are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields and with other highly motivated PhD students. The faculty are extremely enthusiastic about identifying and rigorously addressing interesting research problems. I feel lucky to have been a part of that environment during my PhD and it is through my interactions with the faculty that I have been able to develop my own academic research agenda.

 









 


Devendra Kale


PhD in Management Science, Accounting

Assistant Professor, 
 University of Rhode Island



My time in the PhD program at the Jindal School of Management was about continuous intellectual development and critical thinking skills. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was unaware of the intricacies of academic research. But the well-structured program combined with continued and priceless support from my advisors made this uphill ride a memorable journey. It also helped me discover my passion for academic research and transform into an independent researcher. I strongly recommend Jindal School of Management to future PhD students.

 









 


Aidin Namin


Associate Professor of Marketing Analytics, Loyola Marymount University




Doctoral programs at JSOM provide a diverse, inclusive, and research-intensive learning environment. The wonderful faculty and advisors train students on state-of-the-art quantitative techniques so that the students can conduct impactful research and build their academic career.

 









 


Wei Chen


Assistant Professor in Analytics, Information & Operations,

 School of Business, University of Kansas



When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.

 









 


Subodha Kumar


Distinguished Fellow of the Information Systems Society, INFORMS 

Paul R. Anderson Distinguished Chair Professor, 

Marketing and Supply Chain Management, 
Fox School of Business, Temple University



The PhD program at the Jindal School of Management prepared me for a successful career in academia. During my doctoral studies, I was fortunate to interact with brilliant professors from different disciplines. They helped me understand how to conduct high-impact research, and mentored me on how to effectively teach. I feel very privileged to have earned my PhD at the Jindal School of Management.

 









 


Tai-Yuan Chen


Alumni Professor of Finance,

 HKUST Business School,

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology



The PhD program at UTD offered solid and life-altering training to students. Faculty members are well-known experts in their own field and most importantly, they are always available whenever students need advice. I was able to coauthor with them and started to build up my research pipeline in early stage . After graduation, with its rapid expansion, the reputation of Jindal School of Management continues to intangibly benefits my academic career. I sincerely appreciate the education from UTD SOM!

 









 


Zhengrui Jiang


Professor of Information Systems,

 School of Business,

Nanjing University



The faculty at the Jindal School of Management is world-renowned for their high research productivity. What is less known is that the training PhD students receive here is also top-notch. Despite their busy schedules, PhD student mentoring is always a priority for the professors. I feel very fortunate that I finished my PhD in Management Science at the Jindal School of Management.

 









 


Jess Cornaggia


Alumni Professor of Finance,

 Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University



The PhD program prepared me for a successful career in academia. I had ample resources to conduct high quality research and, most importantly, I had helpful mentors who really invested in me and taught me the nuances of the profession.

At UTDallas, I met so many excellent professors and classmates, who have become my life-long mentors and friends. The professors are internationally recognized leaders in their areas, full of passion for research, extremely brilliant, and also hard-working. Meanwhile, they devote huge amount of time to helping and guiding PhD students. I feel very lucky to complete my PhD study in Naveen Jindal School of Management at UTDallas.

 









 


Blair Flicker


Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina



The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.

 









 


Qi Annabelle Feng


John and Donna Krenicki Chair, 

Professor in Operations Management

Krannert School of Management, Purdue University



During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.

 









 


Harish Guda


Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management 
W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University



The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.

 









 


Haibin Yang


Professor in Strategic Management,

 College of Business, City University of Hong Kong



When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

Mina Ameri


Assistant Professor 
The University of Pittsburgh



I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.

My time in the PhD program at the Jindal School of Management was about continuous intellectual development and critical thinking skills. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was unaware of the intricacies of academic research. But the well-structured program combined with continued and priceless support from my advisors made this uphill ride a memorable journey. It also helped me discover my passion for academic research and transform into an independent researcher. I strongly recommend Jindal School of Management to future PhD students.

When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution.

The faculty at the Jindal School of Management is world-renowned for their high research productivity. What is less known is that the training PhD students receive here is also top-notch. Despite their busy schedules, PhD student mentoring is always a priority for the professors. I feel very fortunate that I finished my PhD in Management Science at the Jindal School of Management.

At UTDallas, I met so many excellent professors and classmates, who have become my life-long mentors and friends. The professors are internationally recognized leaders in their areas, full of passion for research, extremely brilliant, and also hard-working. Meanwhile, they devote huge amount of time to helping and guiding PhD students. I feel very lucky to complete my PhD study in Naveen Jindal School of Management at UTDallas.
  Blair Flicker


Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina



The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.
  Qi Annabelle Feng


John and Donna Krenicki Chair, 

Professor in Operations Management

Krannert School of Management, Purdue University



During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.
  Harish Guda


Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management 
W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University



The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.
  Haibin Yang


Professor in Strategic Management,

 College of Business, City University of Hong Kong



When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

  Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.
  The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.
  Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
  Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
  What does it mean to have a PhD?
  Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.
  Before you apply, get familiar with the admission requirements and application process for Jindal School PhD programs at UT Dallas.

The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.

Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.

The PhD program at UTD offered solid and life-altering training to students.

Qi Annabelle Feng


John and Donna Krenicki Chair, 

Professor in Operations Management

Krannert School of Management, Purdue University



During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.

 









 


Blair Flicker


Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina



The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.

 









 


Bharadwaj Kadiyala

Harish Guda

The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.

 









 


Mina Ameri


Assistant Professor 
The University of Pittsburgh



I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.

 









 


Wei Chen


Assistant Professor in Analytics, Information & Operations,

 School of Business, University of Kansas



When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.

 









 


Haibin Yang

When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

Paragraphs:
  Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions about the UT Dallas Davidson Management Honors Program, including links and resources if you are interested in the student experience at the Naveen Jindal School of Management.
  DMHP students are unique. Generally, though, they are leaders, high achievers and innovators. We seek a diverse cohort of students each year with differing interests, experiences and goals; so there is not one specific type of student with whom you will interact.
  We expect our students to be high achievers. But that does not mean that we only look at your academic record. We also require the submission of a resume and two short essays, along with a recommendation form, as part of your application. Select applicants are interviewed. All the application components allow us to learn more about you. We value a variety of students in our program — with different majors, interests, and goals.
  DMHP students have many opportunities to work with professors. We choose exceptional faculty to teach our classes, and these professors enjoy working with DMHP students. Many of our students build meaningful relationships with faculty that last beyond their time at UT Dallas.
  In addition to being highly selective, we create unique cohorts of students with different majors and experiences. The cohorts are generally small — ranging from 55 to 70 students, allowing for discussion-based classes, more personal interaction and formation of lasting relationships. Creating a DMHP community through service, professional and personal development, travel and social events also sets DMHP apart.
  UT Dallas offers several honors programs, and each program has its own application process. DMHP is unique because it is designed specifically for Jindal School of Management students. This focus allows us to provide you skills and opportunities you need while enrolled in JSOM and for future careers. We highly encourage students to apply to the honors programs and organizations for which they are eligible. The various programs and organizations across campus and within JSOM are designed to complement one another.
  DMHP provides many development opportunities. Challenging academics will ensure that you have the technical skills you need to thrive in your profession or succeed in graduate school. Business site visits, mock interviews, alumni panels, corporate speakers, and professional development workshops will help you select a career and build a network. Study abroad, community service, and personal development events will help you grow as individuals while differentiating you in competitive job or graduate school applicant pools. Students also have opportunities to develop leadership skills by serving as peer mentors, interest group leaders, and ambassadors for the program.
  The program is academically rigorous, and each DMHP class challenges you to develop the skills and knowledge necessary for success. Select faculty teach DMHP cohort classes that offer an enriched teaching and learning environment. Surrounding yourself with faculty and classmates who pursue excellence creates a rewarding academic experience. In most semesters, you will take at least one DMHP cohort class.
  There are DMHP students who double major or minor in fields inside and outside JSOM. If you wish to double major or minor, it is important to work with DMHP staff and your academic advisor to ensure the successful completion of all necessary requirements.
  DMHP students must maintain a minimum 3.25 cumulative GPA every semester to remain in good standing (please note that to graduate with Major Honors students must have a 3.5 GPA).
  DMHP is designed to be a four-year program. However, students can complete the program in three years. Students graduating in fewer than three years are ineligible for DMHP.

  Questions and Answers About DMHP 
Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions about the UT Dallas Davidson Management Honors Program, including links and resources if you are interested in the student experience at the Naveen Jindal School of Management.
  DMHP Culture




What type of students would I interact with in DMHP?


DMHP students are unique. Generally, though, they are leaders, high achievers and innovators. We seek a diverse cohort of students each year with differing interests, experiences and goals; so there is not one specific type of student with whom you will interact. 




How selective is DMHP?


We expect our students to be high achievers. But that does not mean that we only look at your academic record. We also require the submission of a resume and two short essays, along with a recommendation form, as part of your application. Select applicants are interviewed. All the application components allow us to learn more about you. We value a variety of students in our program — with different majors, interests, and goals. 




How often do professors work with students?


DMHP students have many opportunities to work with professors. We choose exceptional faculty to teach our classes, and these professors enjoy working with DMHP students. Many of our students build meaningful relationships with faculty that last beyond their time at UT Dallas.
  DMHP Impact




What makes DMHP unique?


In addition to being highly selective, we create unique cohorts of students with different majors and experiences. The cohorts are generally small — ranging from 55 to 70 students, allowing for discussion-based classes, more personal interaction and formation of lasting relationships. Creating a DMHP community through service, professional and personal development, travel and social events also sets DMHP apart. 




How does DMHP differ from other honors programs or organizations at UT Dallas?


UT Dallas offers several honors programs, and each program has its own application process. DMHP is unique because it is designed specifically for Jindal School of Management students. This focus allows us to provide you skills and opportunities you need while enrolled in JSOM and for future careers. We highly encourage students to apply to the honors programs and organizations for which they are eligible. The various programs and organizations across campus and within JSOM are designed to complement one another.
Honors College Page 




How will DMHP prepare me for my future?


DMHP provides many development opportunities. Challenging academics will ensure that you have the technical skills you need to thrive in your profession or succeed in graduate school. Business site visits, mock interviews, alumni panels, corporate speakers, and professional development workshops will help you select a career and build a network. Study abroad, community service, and personal development events will help you grow as individuals while differentiating you in competitive job or graduate school applicant pools. Students also have opportunities to develop leadership skills by serving as peer mentors, interest group leaders, and ambassadors for the program.
  DMHP Academics




Are DMHP classes challenging? How often do I take an honors class?


The program is academically rigorous, and each DMHP class challenges you to develop the skills and knowledge necessary for success. Select faculty teach DMHP cohort classes that offer an enriched teaching and learning environment. Surrounding yourself with faculty and classmates who pursue excellence creates a rewarding academic experience. In most semesters, you will take at least one DMHP cohort class.
DMHP Courses 




Does being in DMHP prevent me from pursuing double majors or minors?


There are DMHP students who double major or minor in fields inside and outside JSOM. If you wish to double major or minor, it is important to work with DMHP staff and your academic advisor to ensure the successful completion of all necessary requirements. 




What are DMHP’s GPA requirements?


DMHP students must maintain a minimum 3.25 cumulative GPA every semester to remain in good standing (please note that to graduate with Major Honors students must have a 3.5 GPA). 




Can I be in DMHP if I plan to graduate early?


DMHP is designed to be a four-year program. However, students can complete the program in three years. Students graduating in fewer than three years are ineligible for DMHP.

  Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.
  The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.
  Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
  Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
  What does it mean to have a PhD?
  Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.

Wei Chen


Assistant Professor in Analytics, Information & Operations,

 School of Business, University of Kansas



When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.

The PhD program at the Jindal School of Management prepared me for a successful career in academia. During my doctoral studies, I was fortunate to interact with brilliant professors from different disciplines. They helped me understand how to conduct high-impact research, and mentored me on how to effectively teach. I feel very privileged to have earned my PhD at the Jindal School of Management.

Gies College of Business, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  



PhD education at Jindal School of Management transformed me from an undergraduate student who never heard of accounting research to an accounting researcher and teacher at world renowned academic institutions. All credit goes to the faculty members and especially my advisors who patiently invested their valuable time in my PhD training. I enjoyed all moments we shared together as student-mentor, co-authors, colleagues and friends.

 









 


Harish Guda


Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management 
W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University



The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.

 









 


Bharadwaj Kadiyala


Assistant Professor,

  Eccles School of Business, University of Utah



The PhD program at UTD provides a fantastic environment for learning and sharing ideas with faculty who are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields and with other highly motivated PhD students. The faculty are extremely enthusiastic about identifying and rigorously addressing interesting research problems. I feel lucky to have been a part of that environment during my PhD and it is through my interactions with the faculty that I have been able to develop my own academic research agenda.

 









 


Blair Flicker


Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina



The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.

 









 


Steve Sauerwald


Associate Professor, Department of Managerial Studies, College of Business, University of Illinois at Chicago

Haibin Yang


Professor in Strategic Management,

 College of Business, City University of Hong Kong



When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

Qi Annabelle Feng


John and Donna Krenicki Chair, 

Professor in Operations Management

Krannert School of Management, Purdue University



During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.

 









 


Mina Ameri


Assistant Professor 
The University of Pittsburgh



I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.







 

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.







 

What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.







 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.

- FAQ
Content:
No, you are not eligible. One of the requirements is to have a minimum UTD GPA of 3.400 that you have not earned yet. However, you are welcome to apply for employment the following semester.
No.
TA assignments are determined by the hiring program based on the needs of the department and faculty. The hiring departments review all applications and select applicants based on several criteria, including the highest number of credit hours completed, highest GPA earned and academic performance in UTD courses. For example, an applicant who has completed 15 semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA has priority over an applicant who has completed nine semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA.
You are not a TA/RA until the UTD HR completes all hiring paperwork.
The out-of-state, non-Texas resident or international students with an F1 visa are eligible for the in-state tuition work for 20 hours per week.
Your salary will be deposited into your account at the end of each month. However, depending on when you completed your hiring paperwork and the cut-off date for the payroll, you may not receive your first paycheck. Instead, you would receive it the following month.
No, you must apply online again each semester. The assistantship is not automatically renewed, and prior employment does not guarantee nor warrant any subsequent appointment.
No. You must not seek an internship and/or a job placement while being a TA/RA. If you leave, the implications on faculty and hundreds of students are significant because you leave them with no support. Also, if you received an in-state tuition, it will be revoked immediately, and you must refund UTD as well.
Yes, your employment is binding. Remember, a government-funded university hires you.
You must meet and discuss any possible issues with the faculty directly. Most often, straightforward communication with the faculty would resolve the issue. Contact the Area Coordinator of the class to which you are assigned if there are unresolved issues with your assigned faculty member.
Yes, the TA/RA employment requires two specific orientations: 1)UTD Office of Graduate Studiesand 2) JSOM graduate office. It is your responsibility to attend both orientations as stated in the requirements. Otherwise, you will be dropped from the assistantship (no exceptions). This also means that you must change your personal travel plans, if any, to ensure you can attend both orientations. Orientations are in-person, and in some situations, they might be online.

A note regarding tuition rates for the Class of 2016 (new incoming students for Fall 2012)
By direction of The University of Texas System Board of Regents, the tuition rate set for the Class of 2016 was reduced by subsidy. Undergraduate resident students who enrolled for the first time in Fall 2012 will see a decrease of between $12 and $55 on tuition bills for Spring 2013. This new rate will be their guaranteed rate through 2016. Students who enroll at UT Dallas from Sept. 1, 2012 through Aug. 31, 2013 will be subject to this new rate.
Questions you may have:
Was I overcharged for the Fall 2012 semester?
No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the subsidy was provided in November of the Fall semester and has been apportioned to reduce the rate for all four years of the Class of 2016’s tuition guarantee.
Will I get a rebate for Fall 2012?
No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the tuition subsidy became available in November 2012.
Why aren’t other classes receiving a subsidy?
The funding subsidy was intended to address increases in tuition as of the academic year beginning in Fall 2012.

UT Dallas offers two different tuition plans. The variable tuition rate plan is based on a traditional plan that only locks tuition rates in for one academic year at a time. The rates on the variable tuition plan are subject to change each academic year and is a lower rate over the guaranteed tuition rate.
The guaranteed tuition plan is a plan that locks tuition rates in for four consecutive years and protects the student against increases during those four years. This plan is designed to aid students and families in the budget and planning of college expenses and is initially higher than the variable tuition rate.
All new admitted students are automatically placed into the Variable Tuition Rate plan and no action is required.
The deadline for spring 2025 admits to change their tuition plan to the guaranteed rate has passed.
Students admitted for the summer 2025 semester will have the opportunity to change their tuition plan beginning April 1, 2025.
The following grid is an example of tuition expenses, comparing the variable tuition rate plan and the guaranteed tuition plan for a new incoming undergraduate resident student. The example enrollment of 15 hours per semester.
Note: Example for undergraduate resident students only and does not include course-related fees, or other charges.

A note regarding tuition rates for the Class of 2016 (new incoming students for Fall 2012)
By direction of The University of Texas System Board of Regents, the tuition rate set for the Class of 2016 was reduced by subsidy. Undergraduate resident students who enrolled for the first time in Fall 2012 will see a decrease of between $12 and $55 on tuition bills for Spring 2013. This new rate will be their guaranteed rate through 2016. Students who enroll at UT Dallas from Sept. 1, 2012 through Aug. 31, 2013 will be subject to this new rate.
Questions you may have:
Was I overcharged for the Fall 2012 semester?
No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the subsidy was provided in November of the Fall semester and has been apportioned to reduce the rate for all four years of the Class of 2016’s tuition guarantee.
Will I get a rebate for Fall 2012?
No, the tuition rate at the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester was correct. Funding for the tuition subsidy became available in November 2012.
Why aren’t other classes receiving a subsidy?

Jindal Home>About the Jindal School of Management>Message from the DeanMessage from the DeanDean Hasan PirkulWelcome to The University of Texas at Dallas Naveen Jindal School of ManagementWe are in the middle of another exciting and busy fall semester at the Naveen Jindal School of Management. I am excited to share with you the “big” news; on October 8th we broke ground for our third building. I am pleased to announce that we have designed a beautiful new facility that is going to contain state-of-the-art classrooms, labs and lecture studios. It will house our undergraduate programs as well as our executive education operations. It has many indoor and outdoor spaces for our students, faculty and staff to relax and interact. The building is planned to be 127,000 sq. ft. When completed in late spring 2026, we will have a total of nearly half a million square feet of world class facilities dedicated to our School.This year’s Scholarship Breakfast, the Jindal School’s largest fundraiser, followed the groundbreaking by one day and was a big success. We raised more than $120,000 for student scholarships and were treated to a presentation by one of the Jindal School’s distinguished alumni, Dr. Sulman Ahmed, BS’01, founder, chairman and CEO of DECA Dental Group. We also announced an endowed scholarship, the Dr. Sulman Ahmed Scholarship Fund, a permanent endowment for the support of students in the Jindal School’s Young Scholars Program, which serves predominantly underrepresented and first-generation students.Our School is known for academic programs that prepare students to utilize quantitative, analytical methods and Information technology tools to solve business problems. In keeping with maintaining our status as innovators at the forefront of technology, we have been busy updating our curricula and developing new programs. As part of these efforts, we held our first annual Cybersecurity Day this semester with a panel of chief information security officers at various corporations and organizations. Our keynote speaker was Ron Mehring, CISO of Texas Health Resource.Another area of significant interest is AI. Over the past year, we have been busy updating our degree programs to address the changes that are taking place in business practice due to the new AI tools that are being rapidly deployed by companies. AI is already transforming the way we work. We are educating our students to have the skills to take on these jobs that are changed or created by AI. This semester we have over 500 Undergraduate and 1600 Masters students enrolled in our Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence degree programs. That is more than 20 percent of our total enrollment. We have also developed and are redeveloping new courses and updating our existing courses to infuse the impact of AI in all of our degree programs such as marketing, finance, supply chain etc. We are also establishing a leadership position in the study and practice of AI in Business Schools. Last spring we hosted the first annual conference “Biz AI Conference: AI Applications in Business Research”. The conference was a big hit with over 150 attendees coming from 67 different universities. AI and related issues are also addressed in other meetings that we organize such as the 16th Annual Project Management Symposium that we offered this summer and 22’nd Conference on Corporate Governance that we held earlier this month. It is safe to say that companies need workers with AI skills in nearly every field and we at the Jindal School are leading the way in preparing our students for those jobs.Our outstanding faculty members have been making news as academic thought leaders. A change in the U.S. Department of Labor’s nationwide overtime rules was inspired by research conducted by Jindal School researchers. The study was conducted by Dr. Umit Gurun, Stan Liebowitz Distinguished Professor of Accounting; Dr. Bugra Ozel, an associate professor of Accounting both of are members of our School; and a fellow researcher from Harvard. The change in the rules will benefit about 4.3 million U.S. workers.Dr. Mike Peng, O.P. Jindal Distinguished Chair and a professor in the Organizations, Strategy and International Management Area, was elected as president of Asia Academy of Management (AAOM). Peng and fellow researchers who happen to be PhD alumni from the Jindal School won a Best Paper award from the International Management Division of the Academy of Management for their work investigating the acquisition strategies of emerging multi-national enterprises from emerging economies.Dr. Hyesook Chung, an assistant professor in the Jindal School’s Organizations, Strategy and International Management Area, received a Best Convention Paper award from the Human Resources Division of the Academy of Management for a study that explores the effects on employees following company mergers and acquisitions.In student news, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) recognized the UT Dallas-JSOM student chapter with aCum Laudedesignation. Dr. Monica Brussolo, the faculty advisor, was awarded the INFORMS2024 Chapter Moving Spirit Award. This year our undergraduate program presented its inaugural Undergraduate Student Conference, allowing many to experience an academic conference for the first time while equipping all of them with tools for academic and professional success. As always our students participate in may regional and national competitions and make us proud with many top awards.I am happy to share with you a new program at the Jindal School, Nash Leaders, was launched last spring. This program helps develop leadership qualities in JSOM students. It is named after and is supported by an endowment created by JSOM alumnus Ron Nash, who is a North Texas business leader and recipient of the 2011 UT Dallas Distinguished Alumni Award. He is also a life member of the UT Dallas Executive Board and a member and past chairman of the Jindal School’s Advisory Council.We continue to improve our rankings, solidifying our position among the top public business schools in the nation. In the most recent ranking news, our graduate program in supply chain management maintained its No. 4 ranking in the Gartner Supply Chain University Top 25 among North American universities while our BS in supply chain management and analytics moved up two places to No. 6.U.S. New & World Reportranked our Professional MBA program at No. 8 (tied) among public university programs and No. 13 (tied) overall in its 2024 Best Part-Time MBA Programs.Fortuneranked our Executive MBA program at No. 9 among public programs and No. 16 overall in its Best Executive MBA Programs 2024.It has been a busy semester, but one that has been fruitful and rewarding. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone connected to the Jindal school — students, faculty, alumni, friends and supporters — for your generous support in both your time, talent and gifts. We are truly grateful to you. Nothing we do would be possible without your support.Dr. Hasan PirkulDean and Caruth Chair of ManagementLearn more about Jindal School academic programs.Undergraduate|MS|MBA|PhD|Executive Education

Naveen Jindal

Since Naveen Jindal earned his MBA from UT Dallas in 1992, he has thrived beyond college successes to become a leading industrialist, practiced statesman and driving force for higher education in his home country, India.

Named a2010 UT Dallas Distinguished Alumnus, he targeted support to the School of Management in thelargest alumni giftever given to the University at that time. His gift, together with that of fellow alumni Charles and Nancy Davidson, created a philanthropic package valued, with matching funds, at $45 million. The University of Texas Board of Regents recognized his philanthropy by naming the school the Naveen Jindal School of Management.

“My vision and desire,” Jindal said, “is that the [Jindal] School of Management becomes the school of choice for some of the brightest and best individuals who will truly lead us into the next generation, leaders who will truly embrace the global vision and balance the needs of the people with the environment in an ethical and sustainable manner.”

In memory of his late father, Naveen Jindal founded and is chancellor of the O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU) in Haryana, India. JGU has eight schools: art and architecture, banking and finance, business, government and public policy, international affairs, journalism and communication, law and liberal arts and humanities.

Jindal’s business career has roots in the O.P. Jindal Group, a multibillion-dollar family conglomerate. He serves as chairman ofJindal Steel and Power Limited, a steel manufacturer that has diversified into cement production, mining, oil and gas and power generation.

A national record holder in India for skeet shooting and an adept polo player, Jindal found another passion while at UT Dallas — politics. He served first as Student Government vice president and then president, at the same time earning the Student Leader of the Year Award.

Inspired by displays of the U.S. flag on campus, he later successfully challenged India’s Flag Code, which allowed the banner to be put on view only on special occasions. The effort led him to found the Flag Foundation of India and birthed his parliamentary career. He served two five-year terms in the Lok Sabha, Parliament’s lower house. Besides education, his public and private development initiatives have focused on healthcare, infrastructure, women’s empowerment and youth.

In 2023, Jindal returned to UT Dallas as one of the university’s most accomplished alumni, noted as a global leader in industry, a statesman in his home country of India, an advocate for human rights and a record-holding sportsman. He was presented with the University’s Lifetime Achievement Award.

At the Awards Gala, Jindal said receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award renewed his commitment to making a difference in the world. “For me, this award is not just a recognition of my past accomplishments, but a call to action for the future,” Jindal said. “There is still so much work to be done, but I believe we all have a responsibility to use our talents and resources to make the world a better place.”

The University of Texas Board of Regents recognized his philanthropy by naming the school the Naveen Jindal School of Management.“My vision and desire,” Jindal said, “is that the [Jindal] School of Management becomes the school of choice for some of the brightest and best individuals who will truly lead us into the next generation, leaders who will truly embrace the global vision and balance the needs of the people with the environment in an ethical and sustainable manner.”In memory of his late father, Naveen Jindal founded and is chancellor of the O.P. Jindal Global University (JGU) in Haryana, India. JGU has eight schools: art and architecture, banking and finance, business, government and public policy, international affairs, journalism and communication, law and liberal arts and humanities.Jindal’s business career has roots in the O.P. Jindal Group, a multibillion-dollar family conglomerate. He serves as chairman ofJindal Steel and Power Limited, a steel manufacturer that has diversified into cement production, mining, oil and gas and power generation.A national record holder in India for skeet shooting and an adept polo player, Jindal found another passion while at UT Dallas — politics. He served first as Student Government vice president and then president, at the same time earning the Student Leader of the Year Award.Inspired by displays of the U.S. flag on campus, he later successfully challenged India’s Flag Code, which allowed the banner to be put on view only on special occasions. The effort led him to found the Flag Foundation of India and birthed his parliamentary career. He served two five-year terms in the Lok Sabha, Parliament’s lower house. Besides education, his public and private development initiatives have focused on healthcare, infrastructure, women’s empowerment and youth.In 2023, Jindal returned to UT Dallas as one of the university’s most accomplished alumni, noted as a global leader in industry, a statesman in his home country of India, an advocate for human rights and a record-holding sportsman. He was presented with the University’s Lifetime Achievement Award.At the Awards Gala, Jindal said receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award renewed his commitment to making a difference in the world. “For me, this award is not just a recognition of my past accomplishments, but a call to action for the future,” Jindal said. “There is still so much work to be done, but I believe we all have a responsibility to use our talents and resources to make the world a better place.”
