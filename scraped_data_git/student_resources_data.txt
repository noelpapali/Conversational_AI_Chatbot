TA assignments are determined by the hiring program based on the needs of the department and faculty. The hiring departments review all applications and select applicants based on several criteria, including the highest number of credit hours completed, highest GPA earned and academic performance in UTD courses. For example, an applicant who has completed 15 semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA has priority over an applicant who has completed nine semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA.
You are not a TA/RA until the UTD HR completes all hiring paperwork.
The out-of-state, non-Texas resident or international students with an F1 visa are eligible for the in-state tuition work for 20 hours per week.
Your salary will be deposited into your account at the end of each month. However, depending on when you completed your hiring paperwork and the cut-off date for the payroll, you may not receive your first paycheck. Instead, you would receive it the following month.

It is your responsibility to attend both orientations as stated in the requirements. Otherwise, you will be dropped from the assistantship (no exceptions).
