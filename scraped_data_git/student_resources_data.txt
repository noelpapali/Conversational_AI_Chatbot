- FAQ
Content:
No, you are not eligible. One of the requirements is to have a minimum UTD GPA of 3.400 that you have not earned yet. However, you are welcome to apply for employment the following semester.
No.
TA assignments are determined by the hiring program based on the needs of the department and faculty. The hiring departments review all applications and select applicants based on several criteria, including the highest number of credit hours completed, highest GPA earned and academic performance in UTD courses. For example, an applicant who has completed 15 semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA has priority over an applicant who has completed nine semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA.
You are not a TA/RA until the UTD HR completes all hiring paperwork.
The out-of-state, non-Texas resident or international students with an F1 visa are eligible for the in-state tuition work for 20 hours per week.
Your salary will be deposited into your account at the end of each month. However, depending on when you completed your hiring paperwork and the cut-off date for the payroll, you may not receive your first paycheck. Instead, you would receive it the following month.
No, you must apply online again each semester. The assistantship is not automatically renewed, and prior employment does not guarantee nor warrant any subsequent appointment.
No. You must not seek an internship and/or a job placement while being a TA/RA. If you leave, the implications on faculty and hundreds of students are significant because you leave them with no support. Also, if you received an in-state tuition, it will be revoked immediately, and you must refund UTD as well.
Yes, your employment is binding. Remember, a government-funded university hires you.
You must meet and discuss any possible issues with the faculty directly. Most often, straightforward communication with the faculty would resolve the issue. Contact the Area Coordinator of the class to which you are assigned if there are unresolved issues with your assigned faculty member.
Yes, the TA/RA employment requires two specific orientations: 1)UTD Office of Graduate Studiesand 2) JSOM graduate office. It is your responsibility to attend both orientations as stated in the requirements. Otherwise, you will be dropped from the assistantship (no exceptions). This also means that you must change your personal travel plans, if any, to ensure you can attend both orientations. Orientations are in-person, and in some situations, they might be online.

Questions and Answers:
Q: Are BCC services free?
A: Yes.
Q: Do I need to make an appointment?
A: Yes. Walk-ins are welcomed, but when assignments are due, appointments fill up quickly. To ensure you get the time you need, schedule an appointment here:Book Now
Q: Should I make an appointment EARLY?
A: Yes. The BCC gets VERY busy right before writing assignments are due. Making an appointment early ensures that you get help when you need it.
Q: Will the tutor edit my grammar and/or punctuation or write a paper for me?
A: No. Tutors do not “fix” or “edit” student papers or documents at all. Instead, tutors will help you to identify patterns of errors in your work so that you learn to identify and correct the errors yourself. Tutors will NOT write a paper or any other document for students.
Q: Will the tutor correct all my mistakes?
A: No. Tutors do not edit student work. To help students become more skillful and independent writers, tutors help students identify issues that need attention so students can correct the errors themselves.
Q: Will the tutor help me get a better grade on my assignment?
A: Not necessarily. The tutors will provide feedback on your work. For example, feedback can help you improve your writing, strengthen your arguments and improve your slides. You can also practice your presentations.
Q: How often can I visit the BCC?
A: You may schedule up to three appointments a week, but only one appointment per day.

Questions and Answers:
Q: Who can visit the BCC? Who are the staff members?
A: Currently enrolled JSOM undergraduate, graduate and PhD students may attend the BCC. Tutors are full and part-time professionals with writing center experience. The BCC may occasionally hire student workers with exemplary written and verbal communication skills.Although tutors are not content experts, they are skilled writers with training in tutoring, so they are able to help students with communication issues that do not require advanced subject knowledge.
