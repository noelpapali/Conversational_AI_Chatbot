What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.







 

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.







 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.







 

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.

Devendra Kale

PhD in Management Science, Accounting
Assistant Professor, 
 University of Rhode Island


My time in the PhD program at the Jindal School of Management was about continuous intellectual development and critical thinking skills. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was unaware of the intricacies of academic research. But the well-structured program combined with continued and priceless support from my advisors made this uphill ride a memorable journey. It also helped me discover my passion for academic research and transform into an independent researcher. I strongly recommend Jindal School of Management to future PhD students.
 









 


Zhengrui Jiang

Professor of Information Systems,
 School of Business,
Nanjing University


The faculty at the Jindal School of Management is world-renowned for their high research productivity. What is less known is that the training PhD students receive here is also top-notch. Despite their busy schedules, PhD student mentoring is always a priority for the professors. I feel very fortunate that I finished my PhD in Management Science at the Jindal School of Management.
 









 


Haibin Yang

Professor in Strategic Management,

When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

Assistant Professor 
The University of Pittsburgh


I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.

Blair Flicker

Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina


The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.

  Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.
  Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
  The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.
  What does it mean to have a PhD?
  Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.
  Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
  Before you apply, get familiar with the admission requirements and application process for Jindal School PhD programs at UT Dallas.

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.







 

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.







 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.







 

What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.

Blair Flicker

Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina


The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.
 









 


Wei Chen

More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.

Paragraphs:
  Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions about the UT Dallas Davidson Management Honors Program, including links and resources if you are interested in the student experience at the Naveen Jindal School of Management.
  DMHP students are unique. Generally, though, they are leaders, high achievers and innovators. We seek a diverse cohort of students each year with differing interests, experiences and goals; so there is not one specific type of student with whom you will interact.
  We expect our students to be high achievers. But that does not mean that we only look at your academic record. We also require the submission of a resume and two short essays, along with a recommendation form, as part of your application. Select applicants are interviewed. All the application components allow us to learn more about you. We value a variety of students in our program — with different majors, interests, and goals.
  DMHP students have many opportunities to work with professors. We choose exceptional faculty to teach our classes, and these professors enjoy working with DMHP students. Many of our students build meaningful relationships with faculty that last beyond their time at UT Dallas.
  In addition to being highly selective, we create unique cohorts of students with different majors and experiences. The cohorts are generally small — ranging from 55 to 70 students, allowing for discussion-based classes, more personal interaction and formation of lasting relationships. Creating a DMHP community through service, professional and personal development, travel and social events also sets DMHP apart.
  UT Dallas offers several honors programs, and each program has its own application process. DMHP is unique because it is designed specifically for Jindal School of Management students. This focus allows us to provide you skills and opportunities you need while enrolled in JSOM and for future careers. We highly encourage students to apply to the honors programs and organizations for which they are eligible. The various programs and organizations across campus and within JSOM are designed to complement one another.
  DMHP provides many development opportunities. Challenging academics will ensure that you have the technical skills you need to thrive in your profession or succeed in graduate school. Business site visits, mock interviews, alumni panels, corporate speakers, and professional development workshops will help you select a career and build a network. Study abroad, community service, and personal development events will help you grow as individuals while differentiating you in competitive job or graduate school applicant pools. Students also have opportunities to develop leadership skills by serving as peer mentors, interest group leaders, and ambassadors for the program.
  The program is academically rigorous, and each DMHP class challenges you to develop the skills and knowledge necessary for success. Select faculty teach DMHP cohort classes that offer an enriched teaching and learning environment. Surrounding yourself with faculty and classmates who pursue excellence creates a rewarding academic experience. In most semesters, you will take at least one DMHP cohort class.
  There are DMHP students who double major or minor in fields inside and outside JSOM. If you wish to double major or minor, it is important to work with DMHP staff and your academic advisor to ensure the successful completion of all necessary requirements.
  DMHP students must maintain a minimum 3.25 cumulative GPA every semester to remain in good standing (please note that to graduate with Major Honors students must have a 3.5 GPA).
  DMHP is designed to be a four-year program. However, students can complete the program in three years. Students graduating in fewer than three years are ineligible for DMHP.

  Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.
  Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
  The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.
  What does it mean to have a PhD?
  Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.
  Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.

The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose.

Blair Flicker

Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina


The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.

What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.







 

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.







 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.







 

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
