 PhD Resource Articles 
Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.





 

What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.







 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.







 

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.







 

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.

What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.







 

What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.







 

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.







 

Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.

Zhengrui Jiang

Professor of Information Systems,
 School of Business,
Nanjing University


The faculty at the Jindal School of Management is world-renowned for their high research productivity. What is less known is that the training PhD students receive here is also top-notch. Despite their busy schedules, PhD student mentoring is always a priority for the professors. I feel very fortunate that I finished my PhD in Management Science at the Jindal School of Management.
 









 


Wei Chen

Assistant Professor in Analytics, Information & Operations,

When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.
 









 


Haibin Yang

Professor in Strategic Management,
 College of Business, City University of Hong Kong


When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards
 









 


Tai-Yuan Chen

The PhD program at UTD provides a fantastic environment for learning and sharing ideas with faculty who are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields and with other highly motivated PhD students.

Devendra Kale

PhD in Management Science, Accounting
Assistant Professor, 
 University of Rhode Island


My time in the PhD program at the Jindal School of Management was about continuous intellectual development and critical thinking skills. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was unaware of the intricacies of academic research. But the well-structured program combined with continued and priceless support from my advisors made this uphill ride a memorable journey. It also helped me discover my passion for academic research and transform into an independent researcher. I strongly recommend Jindal School of Management to future PhD students.
 









 


Blair Flicker

Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina


The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.
 









 


Jess Cornaggia

Alumni Professor of Finance,

During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.
 









 


Mina Ameri

Assistant Professor 
The University of Pittsburgh


I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.
 









 


Harish Guda

Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management 
W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University


The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.

Paragraphs:
  The PhD Program provides funding to qualified doctoral students and guarantees four to five years of support based on academic performance. Students making satisfactory progress normally receive a full tuition & fee waiver and funding in the form of a teaching assistantship or scholarship. The PhD Program announces the assistantship and scholarship awards at the time of admission decisions. PhD students are also provided an ample research budget for presenting their work at premier conferences.
  The starting yearly stipend for full-time doctoral students is $39,300 over 12 months beginning in Fall 2024. Doctoral stipends are awarded in the form of a Teaching or Research Assistantship. Teaching Assistants (TAs) are employed a maximum of 20 hours per week to help meet the instructional needs of the University. Research Assistants (RAs) are employed a maximum of 20 hours per week to assist the research efforts of the faculty in a capacity that relates to the student’s educational goals. Typically, students awarded assistantships receive a full tuition waiver, with student medical insurance also covered by the university.
  Students applying for admission will be automatically considered for the Eugene McDermott Graduate Fellows program, which provides additional research support and funding as a research assistant for 4-5 years. Details can be found below in the Eugene McDermott Graduate Fellows section.
  Every PhD student receiving an assistantship will be eligible for a year-long research fellowship for four semesters (summer, fall, spring, summer). The goal of the fellowship is to help PhD students initiate their research activities early in the program. Students choose a faculty advisor and develop a quality research paper to be presented at the end of the fellowship year.
  Students awarded assistantships are also eligible for part-time employee benefits. UT Dallas offers a dynamic and flexible package of valuable programs.
  Assistantship awards are announced at the time of admission decisions.
  The Jindal School of Management provides each doctoral student generous funds over the course of the program to assist with costs related to traveling to professional meetings and conferences to present research.
  The Office of Graduate Education has designed a PhD Small Grants Program to assist PhD students at UT Dallas with dissertation-based research and travel expenses by offering supplemental financial support on a competitive basis. This funding is in addition to that given by the Jindal School of Management.
  Exceptional applicants will be considered for the Eugene McDermott Graduate Fellows Program. Applicants selected for the program are awarded fellowships as Research Assistants (RA) and receive annually:

12-month stipend of $39,300
Health insurance
Tuition & fees
Discretionary budget of $10,000
Professional development activities and enrichment opportunities
  The award is for 4 years (5th year as needed).15 of the most talented applicants to doctoral programs at UT Dallas will be named fellows. There is no separate application for the program; applicants will be automatically considered during admissions. Details can be found at the Eugene McDermott Graduate Fellows  website.

The PhD program at the Jindal School of Management prepared me for a successful career in academia.

The faculty at the Jindal School of Management is world-renowned for their high research productivity. What is less known is that the training PhD students receive here is also top-notch. Despite their busy schedules, PhD student mentoring is always a priority for the professors. I feel very fortunate that I finished my PhD in Management Science at the Jindal School of Management.

Assistant Professor,

My time in the PhD program at the Jindal School of Management was about continuous intellectual development and critical thinking skills. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was unaware of the intricacies of academic research. But the well-structured program combined with continued and priceless support from my advisors made this uphill ride a memorable journey. It also helped me discover my passion for academic research and transform into an independent researcher. I strongly recommend Jindal School of Management to future PhD students.

During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.

The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.

Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.
 









 


Blair Flicker

Assistant Professor in Management Science

The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.

I also benefited from a great cohort of supportive and bright PhD students who made the journey even more rewarding
  Name: Xuying Zhao
  Quote: At UTDallas, I met so many excellent professors and classmates, who have become my life-long mentors and friends. The professors are internationally recognized leaders in their areas, full of passion for research, extremely brilliant, and also hard-working. Meanwhile, they devote huge amount of time to helping and guiding PhD students. I feel very lucky to complete my PhD study in Naveen Jindal School of Management at UTDallas.
  Name: Haibin Yang
  Quote: When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards
  Name: Wei Chen
  Quote: When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.
  Name: Blair Flicker
  Quote: The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.
  Name: Hasan Cavusoglu
  Quote: Beyond their remarkable intellect, the faculty members at the Jindal School of Management impressed me with their passion for excellence in research, dedication to superb doctoral education and endless patience toward PhD students during my time in the program. They are truly a source of inspiration. I consider myself privileged to have been trained by incredible professors who showed us how to achieve rigor and relevance in research.
  Name: Tai-Yuan Chen
  Quote: The PhD program at UTD offered solid and life-altering training to students. Faculty members are well-known experts in their own field and most importantly, they are always available whenever students need advice. I was able to coauthor with them and started to build up my research pipeline in early stage . After graduation, with its rapid expansion, the reputation of Jindal School of Management continues to intangibly benefits my academic career. I sincerely appreciate the education from UTD SOM!
  Name: Oktay Urcan
  Quote: PhD education at Jindal School of Management transformed me from an undergraduate student who never heard of accounting research to an accounting researcher and teacher at world renowned academic institutions. All credit goes to the faculty members and especially my advisors who patiently invested their valuable time in my PhD training. I enjoyed all moments we shared together as student-mentor, co-authors, colleagues and friends.
  Name: Bharadwaj Kadiyala
  Quote: The PhD program at UTD provides a fantastic environment for learning and sharing ideas with faculty who are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields and with other highly motivated PhD students. The faculty are extremely enthusiastic about identifying and rigorously addressing interesting research problems. I feel lucky to have been a part of that environment during my PhD and it is through my interactions with the faculty that I have been able to develop my own academic research agenda.
  Name: Aidin Namin
  Quote: Doctoral programs at JSOM provide a diverse, inclusive, and research-intensive learning environment. The wonderful faculty and advisors train students on state-of-the-art quantitative techniques so that the students can conduct impactful research and build their academic career.
  Name: Mina Ameri
  Quote: I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.

Paragraphs:
  Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions about the UT Dallas Davidson Management Honors Program, including links and resources if you are interested in the student experience at the Naveen Jindal School of Management.
  DMHP students are unique. Generally, though, they are leaders, high achievers and innovators. We seek a diverse cohort of students each year with differing interests, experiences and goals; so there is not one specific type of student with whom you will interact.
  We expect our students to be high achievers. But that does not mean that we only look at your academic record. We also require the submission of a resume and two short essays, along with a recommendation form, as part of your application. Select applicants are interviewed. All the application components allow us to learn more about you. We value a variety of students in our program — with different majors, interests, and goals.
  DMHP students have many opportunities to work with professors. We choose exceptional faculty to teach our classes, and these professors enjoy working with DMHP students. Many of our students build meaningful relationships with faculty that last beyond their time at UT Dallas.
  In addition to being highly selective, we create unique cohorts of students with different majors and experiences. The cohorts are generally small — ranging from 55 to 70 students, allowing for discussion-based classes, more personal interaction and formation of lasting relationships. Creating a DMHP community through service, professional and personal development, travel and social events also sets DMHP apart.
  UT Dallas offers several honors programs, and each program has its own application process. DMHP is unique because it is designed specifically for Jindal School of Management students. This focus allows us to provide you skills and opportunities you need while enrolled in JSOM and for future careers. We highly encourage students to apply to the honors programs and organizations for which they are eligible. The various programs and organizations across campus and within JSOM are designed to complement one another.
  DMHP provides many development opportunities. Challenging academics will ensure that you have the technical skills you need to thrive in your profession or succeed in graduate school. Business site visits, mock interviews, alumni panels, corporate speakers, and professional development workshops will help you select a career and build a network. Study abroad, community service, and personal development events will help you grow as individuals while differentiating you in competitive job or graduate school applicant pools. Students also have opportunities to develop leadership skills by serving as peer mentors, interest group leaders, and ambassadors for the program.
  The program is academically rigorous, and each DMHP class challenges you to develop the skills and knowledge necessary for success. Select faculty teach DMHP cohort classes that offer an enriched teaching and learning environment. Surrounding yourself with faculty and classmates who pursue excellence creates a rewarding academic experience. In most semesters, you will take at least one DMHP cohort class.
  There are DMHP students who double major or minor in fields inside and outside JSOM. If you wish to double major or minor, it is important to work with DMHP staff and your academic advisor to ensure the successful completion of all necessary requirements.
  DMHP students must maintain a minimum 3.25 cumulative GPA every semester to remain in good standing (please note that to graduate with Major Honors students must have a 3.5 GPA).
  DMHP is designed to be a four-year program. However, students can complete the program in three years. Students graduating in fewer than three years are ineligible for DMHP.

  Find advice and resources you need as you consider joining the PhD program at the UT Dallas Jindal School of Management.
  Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
  Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
  The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.
  What does it mean to have a PhD?
  Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.

Students may enter after previous graduate training or directly from undergraduate programs. Admission is based on grade-point average, GMAT or GRE scores, letters of reference, business and professional experience (if applicable), a written statement of personal objectives and compatibility with faculty research activities. Although both GMAT and GRE scores are accepted, the GMAT is strongly preferred.

Harish Guda

Assistant Professor in Supply Chain Management 
W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University


The six years I spent at JSOM as a PhD student were ones of immense learning. My advisors were extremely patient, and supportive of my learning and growth. The abundant number of courses, seminars, research talks and conferences in the various departments at JSOM provided tremendous exposure to cutting-edge research in Management Science — it often felt like drinking from a firehose. I am grateful to the program for providing me with an excellent learning experience.
 









 


Jess Cornaggia

Alumni Professor of Finance,

The PhD program prepared me for a successful career in academia. I had ample resources to conduct high quality research and, most importantly, I had helpful mentors who really invested in me and taught me the nuances of the profession.
 









 


Mina Ameri

Assistant Professor 
The University of Pittsburgh


I started in the Jindal School of Management knowing nothing about research. But during my 5 years of PhD, I grew from being a student to being a researcher. And it was all because of the help and guidance I received from the kind and caring people there and especially my amazing advisors. Now, my professors and classmates have become my lifetime friends and I will always have what I’ve learned from them, how to work hard, how to not give up, and how to help others on similar journeys.
 









 


Aidin Namin

Associate Professor of Marketing Analytics, Loyola Marymount University

Devendra Kale

PhD in Management Science, Accounting
Assistant Professor, 
 University of Rhode Island


My time in the PhD program at the Jindal School of Management was about continuous intellectual development and critical thinking skills. Prior to joining the PhD program, I was unaware of the intricacies of academic research. But the well-structured program combined with continued and priceless support from my advisors made this uphill ride a memorable journey. It also helped me discover my passion for academic research and transform into an independent researcher. I strongly recommend Jindal School of Management to future PhD students.
 









 


Xuying Zhao

Associate Professor in Operations Management
Mendoza College of Business, University of Notre Dame


At UTDallas, I met so many excellent professors and classmates, who have become my life-long mentors and friends. The professors are internationally recognized leaders in their areas, full of passion for research, extremely brilliant, and also hard-working. Meanwhile, they devote huge amount of time to helping and guiding PhD students. I feel very lucky to complete my PhD study in Naveen Jindal School of Management at UTDallas.
 









 


Oktay Urcan

Associate Professor of Accountancy and Fred & Virginia Roedgers Faculty Fellow

PhD education at Jindal School of Management transformed me from an undergraduate student who never heard of accounting research to an accounting researcher and teacher at world renowned academic institutions. All credit goes to the faculty members and especially my advisors who patiently invested their valuable time in my PhD training. I enjoyed all moments we shared together as student-mentor, co-authors, colleagues and friends.
 









 


Wei Chen

Assistant Professor in Analytics, Information & Operations,
 School of Business, University of Kansas


When I joined the PhD program at UT Dallas, I had a single objective in mind–to become a future faculty member at a research institution. Today, when I look back, I can say that the PhD program, especially the professors, helped me achieve this goal 100%: During my time at UTD, I have obtained invaluable skills that are required to conduct research and communicate with others. More importantly, I have gained confidence as a researcher and a teacher. For this, I am forever grateful.
 









 


Bharadwaj Kadiyala

Assistant Professor,
  Eccles School of Business, University of Utah


The PhD program at UTD provides a fantastic environment for learning and sharing ideas with faculty who are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields and with other highly motivated PhD students. The faculty are extremely enthusiastic about identifying and rigorously addressing interesting research problems. I feel lucky to have been a part of that environment during my PhD and it is through my interactions with the faculty that I have been able to develop my own academic research agenda.
 









 


Haibin Yang

Professor in Strategic Management,
 College of Business, City University of Hong Kong


When I look back, it is amazing to see how much I changed during the four-years I spent in the PhD program at UTD. Before admission, I had no idea about academic research. Upon graduation, my view towards the business world had been fundamentally re-shaped by the theories and methods which I learned at various seminars. Thanks to the tremendous help from my professors, my time at UTD was full of fun, challenges and rewards

The PhD program at the Jindal School of Management prepared me for a successful career in academia.

Qi Annabelle Feng

John and Donna Krenicki Chair, 
Professor in Operations Management
Krannert School of Management, Purdue University


During my time in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from many extremely brilliant and well-respected professors. After graduating from the program, I realized that the benefit I obtained from was not just about writing several high-quality papers with them. They made me understand it is important to go deep and be broad, and they showed me a true scholar is a life-long learner who is always modest and curious.
 









 


Blair Flicker

Assistant Professor in Management Science 
Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina


The PhD program at UT Dallas has been nothing short of life-changing. The faculty—diverse in research interests but unified by deep expertise—turned me into a true scholar. My thinking is so much clearer now compared to when I began the program. My professors prepared me for a successful career as an academic by constantly pushing me, but gently. I had two kids during my studies, yet I was never questioned about how I chose to balance my research progress with family time. I do not know if I could have found a more supportive environment at any other institution.
 









 


Steve Sauerwald

Associate Professor, Department of Managerial Studies, College of Business, University of Illinois at Chicago


In addition to providing outstanding doctoral training, the faculty helped me to identify high impact research areas and provided incredible mentorship to bring those projects to fruition. I also benefited from a great cohort of supportive and bright PhD students who made the journey even more rewarding
 









 


Zhengrui Jiang

The faculty at the Jindal School of Management is world-renowned for their high research productivity. What is less known is that the training PhD students receive here is also top-notch. Despite their busy schedules, PhD student mentoring is always a priority for the professors. I feel very fortunate that I finished my PhD in Management Science at the Jindal School of Management.
 









 


Tai-Yuan Chen

Alumni Professor of Finance,
 HKUST Business School,

The PhD program at UTD offered solid and life-altering training to students. Faculty members are well-known experts in their own field and most importantly, they are always available whenever students need advice.

After graduation, with its rapid expansion, the reputation of Jindal School of Management continues to intangibly benefits my academic career. I sincerely appreciate the education from UTD SOM!
 









 


Hasan Cavusoglu
