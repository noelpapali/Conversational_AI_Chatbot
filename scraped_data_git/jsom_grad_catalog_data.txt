The Master of Science in Financial Technology and Analytics (MS FTEC) at the Naveen Jindal School of Management is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) cohort degree program that requires a minimum of 36 semester credit hours. This Fintech program provides students with the practical and theoretical knowledge needed to pursue careers involving digital financial technologies and financial data analytics. The program is designed for students with or without previous educational background in finance, but with a proclivity toward more computer-based approaches to financial issues.
Students completing this program will gain a knowledge of both finance and the key digital and analytical technologies used in finance. For example, students completing the program will know how use robotic process agents, build blockchains with smart contracts, create cryptocurrencies or tokens for payment systems, use statistical methods for analyzing financial data, and apply machine learning to financial issues. While the full-time program is a cohort program, a part-time program for working professionals is also offered. Both programs only begin each fall. Special tuition, fees and admissions requirements apply since the program is supported entirely by participant tuition/fees.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites, to qualify for the MS degree.
Students pursuing the Master of Science in Financial Technology and Analytics degree program are required to have completed course work covering calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics, and programming with a grade of "B" or better. Applicants who have not satisfied these requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Lean is a collection of concepts that have evolved over many decades but was formally named (as Lean) only in the 1990s. Six Sigma was introduced in the mid-1980s. Both approaches were originally applied to improve manufacturing processes but have become popular in service industries. The two frameworks complement each other and are jointly referred to as Lean Six Sigma. In recent years, Lean Six Sigma and continuous improvement concepts have been applied to healthcare processes in both clinical and administrative areas with to improve patient safety, enhance the quality of care, and reduce overall costs.

The Master of Science in International Management Studies (MS IMS) is a minimum 36 semester credit hours degree program that enables students to strategically manage business operations in both domestic and international settings. Students learn about the analysis of functional areas of domestic and international management, while gaining practical and theoretical knowledge of cultural, sociopolitical, and geographical challenges and opportunities affecting international business decisions. Students must take core courses first, then electives and then courses from a specific concentration.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in both core courses and in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites to qualify for the MS degree. Students can obtain a double MS and MBA degree by taking a total of 63 semester credit hours (assuming they meet all the degree requirements for both programs).
Students pursuing the Master of Science in International Management Studies (MS IMS) degree program are required to complete one semester credit hour ofMAS 6102Professional Development course. Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites, however, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA). All program prerequisites must be satisfied within the first semester of graduate study as a degree-seeking student.
Core Courses: 18 semester credit hours
The IMS core is required for all students and consists of six required courses. Students are encouraged to take core courses before enrolling in elective/track courses. These courses address issues that are fundamental to international management.
Required Courses:
IMS 6304International Business Management
IMS 6310International Marketing Decision Making
IMS 6360International Strategy Analysis and Techniques
IMS 6365Cross-cultural Management Analysis
IMS 6367International Management Capstone

IMS 6302Legal Aspects of International Business Transactions
IMS 6363Regional Area Studies
IMS 6381Managing Global Teams
IMS 6V98International Management Internship
IMS 6V99Special Topics in International Management Studies
Specialized Concentration Options: 9-18 semester credit hours
The MS IMS degree program offers students the opportunity to focus on a specific concentration or select from combination (optional) to obtain in-depth knowledge in a business area of their interests. Students may choose three to six courses (9-18 semester credit hours) from one of the nine specialized concentrations. Students can choose not to declare a concentration.

The Master of Science in Management Science (MS MSc) is a minimum 36 semester credit hours STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) degree program that provides students with flexibility to customize and choose their own course of study by selecting a variety of masters courses and tracks offered by JSOM to satisfy the elective requirements.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in both core courses and in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites to qualify for the MS in Management Science degree. Students also can obtain a double MS MSc and MBA degree by successfully completing a minimum of 63 semester credit hours (if all prerequisites are met).
Students pursuing the Master of Science in Management Science (MS MSc) degree program are required to complete one semester credit hour ofMAS 6102Professional Development course (except specialized Executive Education programs). In addition, knowledge of calculus is required and students who have not completed an undergraduate calculus course may satisfy the prerequisite by completingOPRE 6303Quantitative Foundations of Business. Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites, however, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA). All program prerequisites must be satisfied within the first semester of graduate study as a degree-seeking student.
Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours
Students must satisfactorily complete the following core courses.
MIS 6324Business Analytics with SAS
orMIS 6356Business Analytics with R
MIS 6320Database Foundations
orBUAN 6320Database Foundations for Business Analytics
OPRE 6301Statistics and Data Analysis1
orOPRE 6359Advanced Statistics for Data Science1
OPRE 6332Spreadsheet Modeling and Analytics
NOTE:Students pursuing the Business Analytics area of focus must chooseBUAN 6320instead ofMIS 6320.
Elective Courses: 24 semester credit hours
As a highly flexible program, students may customize and choose their own course of study by selecting a variety of master's-level courses from any unrestricted course/prefix or catalog year offered within JSOM to satisfy the elective requirements. Students are encouraged to consider an area of focus (optional) to obtain an in-depth knowledge in a specific business area depending on their interests. One of the two following electives must be taken to satisfy graduation requirements.
MAS 6009Management Internship2(required elective)
MAS 6V90Individual Study in Management Science
MAS 6V98Management Internship2(required elective)
Capstone Course3(required elective)
Accounting:In today's global and technology-driven environment, managers need skills to effectively analyze accounting information and make value-enhancing decisions. Students may select accounting courses to focus in financial analysis, consulting, corporate governance and tax management. This area of focus can be further refined to the areas of assurance services, taxation, and internal audit.
Business Analytics:An area of focus in business analytics covers statistics and econometrics, predictive modeling, decision and optimization (prescriptive) modeling, and data management. Students are prepared for a position within marketing analytics, decision and operations analytics, financial analytics, healthcare analytics, and IT analytics.
Energy Management:The energy management area of focus will provide students with skills critical to managerial decision making within energy companies, focusing on supply chain, operations, finance, and risk management.
Finance:Students can prepare for careers in corporate finance, investment management, or the management of financial institutions. Courses in this area emphasize creative solutions to business financing problems, the development of value maximizing investment and financing strategies, and the analysis and management of fixed income and equity investments. Students may choose to concentrate in either corporate financial planning or the analysis of financial securities and investment portfolios.
Healthcare Management:The primary goal of this area of focus is to prepare students for leadership positions in healthcare organizations. The healthcare area of focus is cross-functional and industry focused. Courses include cases, projects and assignments that are centered on applying management skills to healthcare issues and organizations. Classes are taught by faculty and healthcare executives who bring special expertise and experience to the program.
Information Technology Management:Information technology is integral to all business operations and permeates all aspects of modern business and our courses will enable students to fully utilize information technology to solve business problems and gain strategic advantage. Advanced courses provide skills necessary for the "supply" side of information technology for IT consulting, software management and e-business.
Innovation and Entrepreneurship:The area of focus in innovation and entrepreneurship prepares students for successful business careers in entrepreneurial new ventures, entrepreneurial finance (venture capital/private equity), or innovation-related roles in mature organizations (product planning, product marketing, product development, more). The area of focus allows students to pursue electives in either the new venture focus area or the innovation within the corporation focus area.
Internal Audit:Today's job market for individuals in internal audit and risk management is exceptional. An area of focus in this area covers internal audit from a broad perspective and addresses review of business processes, technology, governance, ethics, risk assessment and auditing standards, which allows individual to work in any industry or discipline.
International Management:In today's global economy, there is a need to develop skills in various international business environments. Students can take a multidisciplinary approach to study international management, with courses in finance, marketing, strategic management, and legal and cross-cultural management. These integrate concepts and theories with international policies and business practices and prepare students to succeed in developing successful international ventures.
Leadership in Organizations:The leadership area of focus prepares students for management positions through the study of the psychological, sociological and organizational behavior disciplines. The program provides a foundation of leadership theory, building and problem solving in interpersonal work relationships, group dynamics, organizational decision-making and change and ethics.
Marketing:Students learn to understand customers' needs and purchase behaviors, how to satisfy those needs, and how to make a profit in competitive industries and markets. Topics include developing an effective marketing strategy, developing new products and managing different brands, and product categories. Students can also acquire expertise in pricing, advertising and promotions, market research, and retailing strategies.
Project Management:Students in this area of focus may choose project management courses from any existing traditional master's program in JSOM. Project management courses will help a student develop a skill set for planning, organizing, and managing projects in various business settings.
Real Estate:The real estate concentration will provide students with both a practical and educational basis to become skilled decision-makers within the industry. This concentration includes courses in real estate finance and capital markets, covering real estate loans, syndication, securitization, regulation, investment and analysis, combining lectures and case studies to explore the sources of real estate value, project feasibility, strategies for financing, and portfolio management while covering market analysis, government approvals, financing and risk assessment.
Strategic Management:This area of focus focuses on corporate level strategic management, including implementation of strategic designs, top management team leadership, the strategic implications of the social, governmental, technological, and international environments, organization structuring, and strategic alliances. Students will learn how to integrate accounting, finance, economics and organization theory to create sustainable competitive advantage.
Supply Chain Management:Students specializing in supply chain management gain an analytical understanding of how to leverage profits by continuously improving business processes. Effective integration of customers, suppliers, factories and stores through the coordination of various functional areas (marketing, finance, procurement) is an important theme. The area emphasizes using incentives, contracts and information technologies to foster efficiency and success.
Systems Engineering and Management:The area of focus is designed to meet the need for formalized education in design, engineering and management of complex systems involving a large number of interconnected components. It will develop a broad range of engineering and managerial skills that trains students to be managers of large projects that require expertise in both technical and managerial disciplines.
Students in the Management Science degree have the option to pursue a graduate certificate as part of their course of study. Please use the following links to view requirements for the graduate certificates below:
1. OPRE 6359 is a prerequisite for most BUAN courses, and students who desire to take BUAN courses in the future will need to consider taking OPRE 6359 instead of OPRE 6301.
2. Students (except executive education) may use MAS 6009 only for their first internship and any additional internship must be completed as MAS 6V98 (3 semester credit hours maximum).

The Master of Science in Marketing (MS MKT) is a minimum 36 semester credit hour degree program that is designed to meet the needs of students in today's data-driven marketplace, in which the exponential growth in data generated from store scanners and web transactions, navigation, search, and more recently, social media, requires new marketing skills and knowledge. Students may choose from any of the tracks listed below as part of their degree program.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in both core courses and in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites to qualify for the MS degree. Students can also obtain a double MS and MBA degree by taking a total of 63 semester credit hours (assuming they meet all the degree requirements for both programs).
Students pursuing the Master of Science in Marketing degree program must complete one semester credit hour of theMAS 6102Professional Development course. Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites. However, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA). As a degree-seeking student, all program prerequisites must be satisfied within the first semester of graduate study.

Core Courses: 15 semester credit hours

Note that statistics is a required prerequisite for many analytics courses in JSOM. If a student takesMKT 6379Marketing by Numbers and decides later to also takeOPRE 6359,MKT 6379Marketing by Numbers will remain as their core class.
Students however may useOPRE 6359as the unrestricted course/prefix three-semester credit hour master's level course within JSOM as an elective in the degree plan.
Specialized Tracks: 21 semester credit hours
Choose from one of the following five specialized tracks or from the Marketing Management Track. Tracks are for guidance and informational purposes; they will not appear on your degree or transcript. Students may change tracks as long as they can complete the plan requirements. The Marketing Management track offers the most flexibility for those wishing to change tracks or combine courses from different tracks. Students pursuing the degree entirely online should follow the Marketing Management track given that the other five specialized tracks may not have all the courses available online. Students may substitute only one three-semester credit hour master's-level course from any unrestricted course/ prefix offered within JSOM as an elective in the degree plan.

A student lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses must complete prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor. A diagnostic examination may be required. Please consult with the University's general admission requirements, discussed in the graduate catalog, whereas specific admission requirements for the Systems Engineering and Management MS follow.
A student entering the MS program (Traditional Master's) should meet the following guidelines:
The Systems Engineering and Management MS program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to pick up areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time Systems Engineering and Management MS students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time.
The Systems Engineering and Management MS degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the nonthesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36-semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the Systems Engineering and Management MS degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate catalog.
This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the Systems Engineering and Management MS degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements).
An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the Systems Engineering and Management MS degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis.
Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor.
Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an Systems Engineering and Management MS degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester.
The program is designed to be a master's-level cross-disciplinary program to teach engineering and management of all aspects of large and complex systems. The typical Systems Engineering and Management MS student is a high performer with at least a BS degree in engineering, math, physics, chemistry, economics, or finance (in order to ensure adequate math skills).
Our industry partners tell us there is a large and growing unmet need for formalized engineering and management education in increasingly complex macro systems that have a large number of interdependent parts and a significant organizational and/or societal impact. This need exists at the intersection of engineering and management.
Business now requires that engineers be trained to be good managers and leaders, and to be good stewards of corporate or government resources. Conversely, business majors need a better appreciation and understanding of technology and how to manage large and complex engineering projects. They are all expected to be cognizant of the broader impact of their management and engineering activities on their future employers and on society at large.
The objective of the UT Dallas MS in Systems Engineering and Management program is to produce graduates capable of undertaking challenging projects encompassing wide-ranging scientific, engineering and management disciplines. In other words, the objective of the program is to develop an "integrated systems engineering and systems management" skill set among the students who go through this program.
The curriculum will provide students with the knowledge and skills to engineer and manage complex projects that encompass wide-ranging scientific and management disciplines.
Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours
Students are required to take four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from a set of eight courses from the lists below. Two of the courses must be from the Engineering Core section and two from the Management Core section. The four required courses contribute a total of 12 semester credit hours toward the MS degree.

Working with an Systems Engineering and Management MS program advisor, students are required to take four additional and distinct courses either from the remaining SYSM courses listed above or from other courses offered in management or engineering that form a "concentration" or "specialization" in systems-related, possibly industry-specific sectors.
The concentration area consists of four courses (12 semester credit hours) in the degree program; examples include: Aerospace and Defense Systems, Business and Data Analytics, Control and Mechatronic Systems, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, Energy and Infrastructure Systems, Enterprise and Data Management Systems, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management, Global Supply Chain Management, Healthcare Systems, Optimization and Operations Research, Telecom, IT and Multimedia Networks, and Transportation Systems.
Finally, because of the flexible nature of the Systems Engineering and Management MS degree program, students may submit for approval a "personalized" concentration area that focuses on aspects of systems engineering and may combine elements of other concentration areas on a focused theme.
63-65 semester credit hours
The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) and the Naveen Jindal School of Management (JSOM) offer a joint Systems Engineering and Management MS and MBA degree program. This is a 63-65 semester credit hours degree program (excluding pre-requisites) that provides students with opportunities to learn from excellent faculty and places them at the forefront in the fields of systems engineering management and business leadership. This program allows students to earn a combination of a master's level specialist degree in systems engineering and management and an MBA together. Both degrees separately would require significantly more semester credit hours, but in the joint program students can earn both degrees with a smaller total of semester credit hours. Pursuing these degrees together offers students a special opportunity to earn a distinctive set of credentials from UT Dallas.
Faculty and lecturers for the courses in this program are drawn from the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, and from the Naveen Jindal School of Management (see individual faculty listings in the Systems Engineering and Management MS program and the MBA programs).
Students pursuing the double Systems Engineering and Management MS and MBA degree program must meet the admission requirements for both programs and submit all required documents for admission to both programs. Students joining the Traditional Master's in Systems Engineering and Management MS degree program must first complete their 36 semester credit hours of the Systems Engineering and Management MS program. Students have up to six years to accumulate remaining required core hours for the MBA Degree (details with respect to program-specific requirements can be obtained from the advisors for the two programs).
The Systems Engineering and Management MS program offers two certificates: a Certificate in Systems Engineering and a Certificate in Systems Management, primarily intended for students who do not wish to pursue the complete MS degree. Each certificate requires 12 semester credit hours. See Course Descriptions for information on course content. These certificates allow students to fit their education into their busy schedules and pursue the track that best fits their career path. These flexible education programs provide students with outstanding opportunities to access UT Dallas world-class faculty and hands-on learning experiences.
Please see the Systems Engineering and Management MS listing for faculty and lecturers in this program.

This program is for individuals seeking the most advanced academic degree with an emphasis on International Management Studies (IMS). Housed in the Organizations, Strategy, and International Management (OSIM) Area, this program is designed to prepare graduates to assume business school faculty positions in universities.
Students may enter the IMS doctoral program after previous graduate training or directly from undergraduate programs. Desirable educational backgrounds include graduate training in any area of business administration, and graduate or undergraduate degrees in areas such as business administration, economics, sociology, psychology, political science, mathematics, and engineering, although students from other areas are also considered.
All students must take PhD courses that are offered in each of the first two years in the program. Students must satisfy a first-year research paper requirement which will be due at the end of the first year (also known as the preliminary exam). Students also must pass the qualifying (comprehensive in nature) examination, which is administered at the end of the second year of study when all the relevant course requirements have been satisfied. The qualifying examination is intended to assess the student's mastery of the basic theories and methodologies central to the program and to evaluate the student's potential to do original research in an area of specialization. In addition, students must write research papers at the end of their second year. The first and second year papers should be based on two different research projects. All tenure-track and tenured faculty will be involved in evaluating these papers. Students will not be allowed to continue in the program should they fail to pass these evaluations.
After passing the qualifying exam and the second-year paper, each student writes a dissertation proposal, which is defended before a faculty committee appointed in consultation with the dissertation chair. This committee also serves as the supervising committee for the dissertation after the proposal is approved.

The PhD Program in Management Science at the Naveen Jindal School of Management (JSOM) is characterized by a high ratio of research faculty to students, which fosters close working relationships. Core and elective courses provide the students with a thorough understanding of management principles. Coursework incorporates a broad business outlook into the study of theory and practice. A sequence of PhD seminars exposes students to traditional and emerging research issues. Students have the opportunity to be involved in ongoing research projects under the mentorship of experienced faculty. We emphasize involving students in research early in their graduate careers. The close interaction with faculty members enables students to learn to identify and develop research ideas and create their own research agenda. Students also develop their teaching competence under faculty mentorship by teaching organized classes.
The course of study for the PhD in Management Science consists of three phases. First is attaining a background in business concepts. Second is satisfying the requirements for doctoral proficiency. Third is the dissertation. Each area of study - Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, and Operations Management - determines the specific requirements for the three phases. Details can be obtained from the Director of the PhD programs in the Jindal School of Management.
Incoming students complete a two-week math refresher before classes begin in August in preparation for fall classes. Students admitted into the program typically devote two years to the doctoral proficiency coursework and research projects. PhD students take a written preliminary exam at the end of their first year in the program over a set of core methodology courses. They then take a qualifying (comprehensive in nature) exam that they must pass before admission for candidacy for the doctorate degree. After passing the qualifying exam, each student develops his or her dissertation research area, which is usually completed over the next two years.
Doctoral proficiency encompasses courses in research methods, electives or a specialization, doctoral seminars, and a written and oral qualifying examination.

Remaining requirements beyond the core consist of research courses, electives, independent study and seminars as approved by the program committee appointed to guide and evaluate each student. After completion of the coursework to achieve doctoral proficiency and passing the preliminary exam, the student will take a written qualifying (comprehensive in nature) exam which must be passed before formal admission to candidacy for the doctorate. The student must also orally defend the dissertation proposal before starting the dissertation. Written examination in the area of specialization may also be required.
The focal point of the PhD program is the dissertation. The dissertation is written under the direction of the candidate's committee. Twelve to 24 semester credit hours may be granted for the dissertation toward the minimum 75 semester credit hour requirement for the degree. At a time mutually agreeable with the candidate and the members of the committee, the student will orally defend his or her dissertation to the satisfaction of the committee. A student must pass in order to have the PhD degree conferred.
Accounting Concentration
This program is for individuals seeking training in the most advanced issues, both theoretical and applied, in the field of accounting. It is designed to prepare them primarily for teaching positions in research- oriented universities. Some students may be placed in senior positions in industry, government, or consulting organizations. The program requires hands-on training in accounting research, supported by work in the disciplines of economics, mathematics, psychology and statistics, culminating in a doctoral dissertation.
Finance Concentration
This program is for individuals seeking the most advanced academic degree with an emphasis in finance. It is designed to prepare them for (1) teaching positions in research-oriented universities, (2) senior staff positions in industry or government, or (3) senior positions in consulting organizations. However, the emphasis is on (1). The program consists of coursework in financial management, investments, and money and capital markets, together with work in the supporting areas of economics, mathematics and statistics; it culminates in a doctoral dissertation.
Information Systems Concentration
This program is designed for individuals who seek training in advanced theoretical and applied issues in the field of information systems. The training prepares students for conducting leading-edge research in topics ranging from the design of optimized systems to the effective use of such systems in organizations. Students undergo rigorous training in research methodologies as well as in the design of information systems. The research conducted is often interdisciplinary in nature, and is characterized by strong analytical modeling of new and emerging issues in information technology creation and management. The program prepares students mainly for academic positions in research universities. Some students may be placed in research positions in industry, government, or consulting organizations.
Marketing Concentration
The purpose of the PhD Program in Management Science with a marketing concentration is to train researchers capable of dealing with the most advanced issues, both theoretical and applied, in the field of marketing. Universities as well as major companies with marketing orientation aggressively recruit PhDs with strong theoretical and research training in marketing. Graduates will have rigorous training in disciplinary areas and research methodology. They will have knowledge of the various research streams in marketing, will have developed a research specialization and a clear perspective on management issues.
Operations Management Concentration
Operations Management emphasizes the development of models, methods, applications and algorithms as they apply to problems in manufacturing and services. All students will be exposed to deterministic and stochastic modeling and will have the option of applying and/or developing these and new methods to solve problems in their selected topics. The goal of the doctoral program in Operations Management is to educate future practitioners and researchers in the concepts and analytical techniques needed to understand and advance scientific solutions to the problems currently faced by operations managers.
The faculty of the school makes intellectual contributions in two areas: fundamental scholarship that advances theory and practice, and applied scholarship that focuses on practical issues. The fundamental work includes traditional basic research as well as applied research that defines new areas of practice and provides general frameworks that address a wide range of application problems. The applied scholarship provides "how-to" frameworks for skilled practitioners, uses demonstration cases to show how theories can be applied, and defines new areas of application for existing tools and techniques.

The combined Master of Science (MS) in Healthcare Leadership and Management with an Emphasis for Physicians - Executive Education and Executive MBA with an Emphasis in Healthcare Leadership and Management (for Physicians) double degree option is provided by the Alliance for Physician Leadership (APL) Program at the Naveen Jindal School of Management. The double degree is a minimum 63 -semester credit hour specialized graduate degree program designed specifically for senior physicians in leadership roles. The Executive MS HCLM (for Physicians) degree plan requires the completion of nine 4-credit hour residential classes which are held on campus. The APL program curriculum is comprised of healthcare-concentrated coursework with classes taught by industry experts that prepare students to effectively lead in an ever-changing, dynamic healthcare environment. The in- residence classes provide a unique, interactive atmosphere where learners discuss relevant topics in healthcare, analyze case studies, and synthesize concepts for real-world application as physician leaders. Learning alongside peers in a hybrid model of in-residence and online classes provides a rich educational experience unique to the APL Program.
Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites, however, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA). Special tuition, fees and admissions requirements apply, and the program is supported entirely by participant tuition/fees.
Core Courses: 63 semester credit hours
The full-day residential classes are structured on a rotation cycle and available approximately every 18 months; a different class is generally offered on campus every two months following a Saturday through Tuesday schedule. Online classes are typically offered at least once per year on a set schedule and follow the standard UT Dallas academic calendar. Students enrolled in the APL Executive MBA degree program have the option to start with either the residential or the online coursework, and courses can be taken in any order. The double degree requires the successful completion of a minimum of 63 credit hours included in the residential and online core coursework.

A student lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses must complete prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor. Specific admission requirements for the Executive MS- SEM follow.
A student entering the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS program should meet the following guidelines:
The Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to pick up areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time.
The Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the nonthesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36-semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate catalog.
This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements).
An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis.
Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor.
Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester.
In the professional format of the systems engineering and management master's degree, you will enjoy the flexibility this degree option affords as you go to school and still keep up with work and personal commitments. There is an entire staff at UT Dallas dedicated to guiding and advising you through the degree planning process. Speak to Dr. Rajiv Shah, P-SEM Program Director, about applying and getting started on your professional master's degree today.
The program is designed to be a master's-level cross-disciplinary program to teach engineering and management of all aspects of large and complex systems. The typical SEM student is a high performer with at least a BS degree in engineering, math, physics, chemistry, economics, or finance (in order to ensure adequate math skills).
Our industry partners tell us there is a large and growing unmet need for formalized engineering and management education in increasingly complex macro systems that have a large number of interdependent parts and a significant organizational and/or societal impact. This need exists at the intersection of engineering and management.
Business now requires that engineers be trained to be good managers and leaders, and to be good stewards of corporate or government resources. Conversely, business majors need a better appreciation and understanding of technology and how to manage large and complex engineering projects. They are all expected to be cognizant of the broader impact of their management and engineering activities on their future employers and on society at large.
The objective of the UT Dallas MS in SEM program is to produce graduates capable of undertaking challenging projects encompassing wide-ranging scientific, engineering and management disciplines. In other words, the objective of the program is to develop an "integrated systems engineering and systems management" skill set among the students who go through this program.
The curriculum will provide students with the knowledge and skills to engineer and manage complex projects that encompass wide-ranging scientific and management disciplines.
Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours
Students are required to take four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the eight courses listed below. Two of the courses must be from the Engineering Core section and two from the Management Core section. The four required courses contribute a total of 12 semester credit hours toward the MS degree.

Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time.
The Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the nonthesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36-semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate catalog.
This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements).
An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis.
Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor.
Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester.
In the professional format of the systems engineering and management master's degree, you will enjoy the flexibility this degree option affords as you go to school and still keep up with work and personal commitments. There is an entire staff at UT Dallas dedicated to guiding and advising you through the degree planning process. Speak to Dr. Rajiv Shah, P-SEM Program Director, about applying and getting started on your professional master's degree today.
The program is designed to be a master's-level cross-disciplinary program to teach engineering and management of all aspects of large and complex systems. The typical SEM student is a high performer with at least a BS degree in engineering, math, physics, chemistry, economics, or finance (in order to ensure adequate math skills).
Our industry partners tell us there is a large and growing unmet need for formalized engineering and management education in increasingly complex macro systems that have a large number of interdependent parts and a significant organizational and/or societal impact. This need exists at the intersection of engineering and management.
Business now requires that engineers be trained to be good managers and leaders, and to be good stewards of corporate or government resources. Conversely, business majors need a better appreciation and understanding of technology and how to manage large and complex engineering projects. They are all expected to be cognizant of the broader impact of their management and engineering activities on their future employers and on society at large.
The objective of the UT Dallas MS in SEM program is to produce graduates capable of undertaking challenging projects encompassing wide-ranging scientific, engineering and management disciplines. In other words, the objective of the program is to develop an "integrated systems engineering and systems management" skill set among the students who go through this program.
The curriculum will provide students with the knowledge and skills to engineer and manage complex projects that encompass wide-ranging scientific and management disciplines.

The Master of Science in Financial Technology and Analytics (MS FTEC) at the Naveen Jindal School of Management is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) cohort degree program that requires a minimum of 36 semester credit hours. This Fintech program provides students with the practical and theoretical knowledge needed to pursue careers involving digital financial technologies and financial data analytics. The program is designed for students with or without previous educational background in finance, but with a proclivity toward more computer-based approaches to financial issues.
Students completing this program will gain a knowledge of both finance and the key digital and analytical technologies used in finance. For example, students completing the program will know how use robotic process agents, build blockchains with smart contracts, create cryptocurrencies or tokens for payment systems, use statistical methods for analyzing financial data, and apply machine learning to financial issues. While the full-time program is a cohort program, a part-time program for working professionals is also offered. Both programs only begin each fall. Special tuition, fees and admissions requirements apply since the program is supported entirely by participant tuition/fees.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites, to qualify for the MS degree.
Students pursuing the Master of Science in Financial Technology and Analytics degree program are required to have completed course work covering calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics, and programming with a grade of "B" or better. Applicants who have not satisfied these requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Students interested in just the Graduate Certificate in Financial Data Science can enroll in the Master of Science of Financial Technology and Analytics program as a part-time student. However, they would need to identify this interest in their application. Students earn this certificate by completing the following courses with a "B" or better.
FTEC 6310Financial Information and Analytics
FTEC 6320Statistical Analysis for Financial Analysis
FTEC 6321Advanced Statistical Analysis for Financial Analysis
FTEC 6V99Special Topics in Financial Technology and Analytics (taken 2 times)
Academic certification programs follow the same application and admission processes as graduate degree programs. All dates and deadlines can be located in the UTD Academic Calendar. Failure to register in advance and on-time results in a late fee. Students may contact the JSOM advising office for details.

The Master of Science in Financial Technology and Analytics (MS FTEC) at the Naveen Jindal School of Management is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) cohort degree program that requires a minimum of 36 semester credit hours. This Fintech program provides students with the practical and theoretical knowledge needed to pursue careers involving digital financial technologies and financial data analytics. The program is designed for students with or without previous educational background in finance, but with a proclivity toward more computer-based approaches to financial issues.
Students completing this program will gain a knowledge of both finance and the key digital and analytical technologies used in finance. For example, students completing the program will know how use robotic process agents, build blockchains with smart contracts, create cryptocurrencies or tokens for payment systems, use statistical methods for analyzing financial data, and apply machine learning to financial issues. While the full-time program is a cohort program, a part-time program for working professionals is also offered. Both programs only begin each fall. Special tuition, fees and admissions requirements apply since the program is supported entirely by participant tuition/fees.
To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites, to qualify for the MS degree.
Students pursuing the Master of Science in Financial Technology and Analytics degree program are required to have completed course work covering calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics, and programming with a grade of "B" or better. Applicants who have not satisfied these requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements).
An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis.
Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor.
Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester.
In the professional format of the systems engineering and management master's degree, you will enjoy the flexibility this degree option affords as you go to school and still keep up with work and personal commitments. There is an entire staff at UT Dallas dedicated to guiding and advising you through the degree planning process. Speak to Dr. Rajiv Shah, P-SEM Program Director, about applying and getting started on your professional master's degree today.
The program is designed to be a master's-level cross-disciplinary program to teach engineering and management of all aspects of large and complex systems. The typical SEM student is a high performer with at least a BS degree in engineering, math, physics, chemistry, economics, or finance (in order to ensure adequate math skills).
Our industry partners tell us there is a large and growing unmet need for formalized engineering and management education in increasingly complex macro systems that have a large number of interdependent parts and a significant organizational and/or societal impact. This need exists at the intersection of engineering and management.
Business now requires that engineers be trained to be good managers and leaders, and to be good stewards of corporate or government resources. Conversely, business majors need a better appreciation and understanding of technology and how to manage large and complex engineering projects. They are all expected to be cognizant of the broader impact of their management and engineering activities on their future employers and on society at large.
The objective of the UT Dallas MS in SEM program is to produce graduates capable of undertaking challenging projects encompassing wide-ranging scientific, engineering and management disciplines. In other words, the objective of the program is to develop an "integrated systems engineering and systems management" skill set among the students who go through this program.
The curriculum will provide students with the knowledge and skills to engineer and manage complex projects that encompass wide-ranging scientific and management disciplines.

A student lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses must complete prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor. Specific admission requirements for the Executive MS- SEM follow.
A student entering the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS program should meet the following guidelines:
The Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to pick up areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time.
The Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the nonthesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36-semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate catalog.
This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements).
An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis.
Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor.
Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an Systems Engineering and Management Executive Education MS degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester.
In the professional format of the systems engineering and management master's degree, you will enjoy the flexibility this degree option affords as you go to school and still keep up with work and personal commitments. There is an entire staff at UT Dallas dedicated to guiding and advising you through the degree planning process. Speak to Dr. Rajiv Shah, P-SEM Program Director, about applying and getting started on your professional master's degree today.
The program is designed to be a master's-level cross-disciplinary program to teach engineering and management of all aspects of large and complex systems. The typical SEM student is a high performer with at least a BS degree in engineering, math, physics, chemistry, economics, or finance (in order to ensure adequate math skills).
Our industry partners tell us there is a large and growing unmet need for formalized engineering and management education in increasingly complex macro systems that have a large number of interdependent parts and a significant organizational and/or societal impact. This need exists at the intersection of engineering and management.
Business now requires that engineers be trained to be good managers and leaders, and to be good stewards of corporate or government resources. Conversely, business majors need a better appreciation and understanding of technology and how to manage large and complex engineering projects. They are all expected to be cognizant of the broader impact of their management and engineering activities on their future employers and on society at large.
The objective of the UT Dallas MS in SEM program is to produce graduates capable of undertaking challenging projects encompassing wide-ranging scientific, engineering and management disciplines. In other words, the objective of the program is to develop an "integrated systems engineering and systems management" skill set among the students who go through this program.
The curriculum will provide students with the knowledge and skills to engineer and manage complex projects that encompass wide-ranging scientific and management disciplines.

Lean is a collection of concepts that have evolved over many decades but was formally named (as Lean) only in the 1990s. Six Sigma was introduced in the mid-1980s. Both approaches were originally applied to improve manufacturing processes but have become popular in service industries. The two frameworks complement each other and are jointly referred to as Lean Six Sigma. In recent years, Lean Six Sigma and continuous improvement concepts have been applied to healthcare processes in both clinical and administrative areas with to improve patient safety, enhance the quality of care, and reduce overall costs.
