Title: About the Jindal School Faculty
Content:
The Naveen Jindal School of Management’s faculty has an excellent reputation based on members’ teaching, research and business expertise. Over 300 educators, including adjunct and visiting professors, work in the school.
Led by JSOM Dean and Caruth ChairDr. Hasan Pirkul, 30 faculty members have been appointed to UT Dallasnamed and endowed posts. An endowed chair or professorship is the highest academic award that the University can bestow on a faculty member, and it lasts as long as the University exists. Thus, it both honors the named holder of the appointment and serves as an enduring tribute to the donor who establishes it.
“Our goal has always been to be among the best business schools in the nation, and we’ve done that with the help of our distinguished faculty members, who are some of the brightest minds in the business world,” Dr. Pirkul said.
