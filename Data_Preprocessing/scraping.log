Ben passed away in a tragic accident in June 2015, two weeks after graduation.

He worked in India, transitioning early to Enterprise Resource Planning. This allowed him the opportunity to operate as a global citizen. He moved to the U.S. and realized that the missing link in his education was an executive MBA from UT Dallas – providing the perfect blend of experience, flexibility, content and brand.
